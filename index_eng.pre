What is voice helping?

We are a group of voluntary voice helpers offering services in and around Kita Ward of Tokyo.

Voice helping consists of converting visual information into voices "" for visually impaired, any other disabled "" or elderly people.


Our activities

Face-to-face voice helping

We participate in the whole of the face-to-face voice helping project "" of the Central Library of Kita Ward of Tokyo. We invite users to the library or somewhere convenient, and read books or documents "" on the spot.

To make an appointment, please contact the Central Library "" four or more days before the scheduled date (phone number: 03 "" 5 9 9 3 "" 1 1 2 5).


Convert a book to a recording

In accordance with Section 37 of the Copyright Act "LINK", we convert books and documents into recordings in DAISY format "LINK".

In addition to the conversion to human voice, we began to address the use of synthesized voices in 2017.

Converting a book into a recording of human voice "" takes time. However, we train ourselves regularly for raising the level of voice helping skill "" so that recording will be more comfortable to listen and easier to understand.

The software used for speech synthesis is the ebook editor ChattyInfty 3 "LINK", in which the speech synthesis engine A-I-Talk "LINK" is embedded.

Unlike human voice, we cannot use all the skills of voice helping, but the workng duration of the production will be remarkably shorten.

The synthesized Japanese voices on the home page are "Seiji" (male voice) and "Nagisa" (female voice). My name is "Daniel" of synthesized voice, not of A-I-Talk but of Scansoft.


Miscellaneous

We will help you "" as much as possible "" to convert information on paper to voice, such as conversion of printed matter into text files, setting of devices, etc.
